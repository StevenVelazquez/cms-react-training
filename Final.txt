Create a new branch in your repo named “final-project”. This branch should be based on “exercise-4”.

Taking everything you’ve learned and built up until now, build out everything else in the Design Comps. (there are multiple pages)

When you’ve finished your final project, send your repo to your lead for review. You may need to update the permissions on your repo to allow your lead to view your work.
