Exercise: Working With An API

Create a new branch in your repo named “exercise-2”. This branch should be based on “exercise-1”.

Create a custom hook for the Marvel API.

Your hook must support handling the loading, success, and error states of the API.

Update your grid of comics to be powered by your new hook instead of the Static Data.
